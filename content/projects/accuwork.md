### Demo

Site: [https://www.accuwork.pro/](https://www.accuwork.pro/)

Code: [https://github.com/devhyun05/Accuwork](https://github.com/devhyun05/Accuwork)

### Inspiration

One of my friend works in Canada immigration and the hard thing is that it is difficult to identify the people's work history. Therefore, if there is a platform that can make it easier to verify, it would be better.

### What it does

Users can record their employment histories in blockchain environment. Also, smart contract will do the prove of employment by the actual company that user worked with. Then, it will be converted to the badge of our company logo and it can be used with 3rd party organization such as linkedin.
